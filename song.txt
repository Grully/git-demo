You better belive I’m coming
You better believe what I say
You better hold on to your promises
Because you bet, you’ll get what you deserve
She’s going to leave him over
She’s gonna take her love away
So much for your eternal vows, well
It does not matter anyway
Why can’t you stay here awhile
Stay here awhile
Stay with me
Oh, all the promises we made
All the meaningless and empty words
I prayed, prayed, prayed
Oh, all the promises we broke
All the meaningless and empty words
I spoke, spoke, spoke
Do-do-do, Do-do-do,
Do-do-do, Do-do-do
What of all the things that you taught me
What of all the things that you’d say
What of all your prophetic preaching
You’re just throwing it all away
Maybe we should burn the house down
Have ourselves another fight
Leave the cobwebs in the closet
'Cos tearing them out is just not right
Why can’t you stay here awhile
Stay here awhile
Stay with me, oh oh
Oh eh, oh eh, oh eh,
Oh eh, Oh Eh x3
Do-do-do, Do-do-do,
Do-do-do, Do-do-do
